## Example Entry

**Student ID:** Alex Chen

**Date:** 2024-12-15

**Time Spent:** 45 minutes

**Focus:** Understanding Git commits and the difference between staging and committing

**Mistake Encountered:** I kept trying to commit files without staging them first, getting confused about why my changes weren't being saved.

**Why It Failed:** I didn't understand that Git has a two-step process: first you stage changes with `git add`, then you commit them with `git commit`. I was trying to skip the staging step.

**Adjustment:** I practiced the full workflow: `git status` to see what's changed, `git add .` to stage everything, then `git commit -m "message"` to commit. I also learned to use `git diff` to see what I'm about to commit.

**Future Success Link:** Now I understand the Git workflow as a process, like tuning an instrument before playing. I'll always check `git status` first to see what stage I'm at in the process.

## Tips for Effective Practice Logging

1. **Be Specific:** Instead of "worked on JavaScript," write "practiced array methods, specifically map() and filter()"

2. **Embrace Mistakes:** Every error is a learning opportunity. Document what went wrong and why.

3. **Reflect Deeply:** Don't just describe what happened - analyze why it happened and what you learned.

4. **Connect to Future:** Always think about how this lesson will help you in future practice sessions.

5. **Use Analogies:** Connect coding concepts to music or other disciplines you understand.

6. **Be Honest:** This is for your learning, not for show. Document your real struggles and breakthroughs.
