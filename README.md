# Open Code Orchestra

Teaching coding through practice and music, from true zero to mastery.

## About

Open Code Orchestra transforms coding education by bridging the discipline of music with programming practice. We believe that learning to code should follow the same methodical, practice-driven approach that musicians use to master their craft.

**Mission:** "Teaching coding through practice and music, from true zero to mastery."

**Tagline:** "Every commit is a note. Every failure is a lesson. Every log is a score."

## Philosophy

Our approach is built on several core principles:

- **Teaching From Zero:** Start with practice logs before writing code, building neural pathways like musicians start with scales
- **Music ↔ Code Bridge:** Treat coding education as musical education, where commits are practice sessions and merges are ensemble work
- **Failure as Currency:** Every mistake is valuable and becomes teaching IP for others
- **Practice Logs as Curriculum:** Commit history is the textbook, logs are the lessons
- **Open Access:** All core tools and explanations are free and sufficient for mastery
- **Truth-First Private Logs:** Capture raw, unfiltered thinking for authentic learning

## Getting Started

1. Clone the `hello-orchestra` repository
2. Duplicate `PRACTICE_LOG.md` into `/practice/yourname.md`
