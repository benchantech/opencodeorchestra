# Open Code Orchestra

Learning coding through practice and music, from true zero to fluency.

## About

Open Code Orchestra transforms coding education by bridging the discipline of music with programming practice. We believe that learning to code should follow the same methodical, practice-driven approach that musicians use to master their craft.

**Mission:** "Learning coding through practice and music, from true zero to fluency."

**Tagline:** "We train together, side by side, building in plain sight."

## Philosophy

Our approach is built on several core principles:

- **Teaching From Zero:** Start with practice logs before writing code, building neural pathways like musicians start with scales
- **Music ↔ Code Bridge:** Treat coding education as musical education, where commits are practice sessions and merges are ensemble work
- **Failure as Currency:** Every mistake is valuable and becomes teaching IP for others
- **Practice Logs as Curriculum:** Commit history is the textbook, logs are the lessons
- **Open Access:** All core tools and explanations are free and sufficient for fluency
