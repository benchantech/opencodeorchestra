# Open Code Orchestra™

Learning coding through practice and music, from true zero to fluency.

---

## About

**Open Code Orchestra™** transforms coding education by bridging the discipline of music with programming practice. We believe that learning to code should follow the same methodical, practice-driven approach that musicians use to master their craft.

> **Mission:** "Learning coding through practice and music, from true zero to fluency."  
> **Tagline:** "We train together, side by side, building in plain sight."

## Philosophy

Our approach is built on several core principles:

- **Teaching From Zero**  
  Start with practice logs before writing code—like musicians start with scales.

- **Music ↔ Code Bridge**  
  Commits are practice sessions; merges are ensemble work.

- **Failure as Currency**  
  Every mistake becomes teaching IP—openly documented, never hidden.

- **Practice Logs as Curriculum**  
  Git history is the textbook. Logs are the lessons.

- **Open Access, With Boundaries**  
  Tools and methods are open. The brand and platform are not.
